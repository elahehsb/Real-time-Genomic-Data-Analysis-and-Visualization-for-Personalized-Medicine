# Real-time-Genomic-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-for-Personalized-Medicine

### Overview
This project aims to analyze genomic data in real-time to provide personalized medicine recommendations. It involves collecting and processing genomic datasets, applying bioinformatics algorithms, developing machine learning models for disease prediction, and visualizing the results through an interactive web application.

#### System Architecture
##### Components:

###### Data Collection: Gather genomic datasets from public repositories like NCBI or EMBL-EBI.
###### Data Storage: Use MongoDB for storing and managing genomic data.
###### Data Processing: Utilize BioPython for processing genomic sequences and performing alignment.
###### Machine Learning: Develop a machine learning model to predict disease risk based on genomic data.
###### Visualization: Create an interactive web application for data visualization and result interpretation.
###### Deployment: Employ Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.
